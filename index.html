            Captain America is one of the most loved superheroes out of all of the Marvel Comics heroes that are out there. A lot of people across the world have enjoyed the vast amount of comic appearances he has made throughout the decades, but I think that Captain America became even more loved by many other people because of his movie appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Portrayed by Chris Evans!). This website is going to go back to his very 1st comic appearance in December 1940 and cover some of the best comic appearances he has made over the last 80 years, and he has made an appearance in over 10,000 issues, and we are also going to cover the live action versions of the character!

        <Header class="question"> Who has held the Captain America mantle?</Header>
        <p class="para2">
            Most fans of Captain America (Or Cap for short) know that the 1st Captain America and the most popular itteration of the character was Steve Grant Rogers. As already stated, he was the very 1st Cap and the person that has held the mantle the longest. However, Steve Rogers is not the only person that has been Captain America. Here we are going to go through the last 80 years of comics and see who has held the mantle of the Star Spangled Man Captain America!
